This add-in for the Tomboy note application makes it easy to copy a note to the clipboard in the format of some popular wikis.

The translation from the Tomboy note xml format is performed with an xslt transformer.

It is possible to add other export formats, and to change or improve the export format translation without having to rebuild the plugin.
